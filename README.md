Your project appears to be a simple Todo List application built with React.

The main component is App, which maintains the state of the todo list and provides functions to manipulate that state. These functions include addTodo, markTodo, and removeTodo, which respectively add a new todo item, mark an existing todo item as completed, and remove an existing todo item.

The App component uses two child components: TodoForm and TodoList. The TodoForm component is a form that allows users to input and submit new todo items. The TodoList component displays the list of todo items. Each item in the list is represented by a TodoItem component, which displays the text of the todo item and buttons to mark the item as completed or remove the item.

The project was bootstrapped with Create React App, as indicated by the scripts and dependencies in your package.json file and the content of your README.md file. The project also includes a test file, App.test.js, which suggests that you are using Jest and the React Testing Library to test your components.

The project also includes some files related to web performance and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), such as reportWebVitals.js and public/manifest.json. This suggests that you might be interested in measuring and improving the performance of your app, or in making your app installable on user devices.
